# Spring 3.1 and Backbone.js integration sample - Todo List

This is a sample application presenting integration of
[Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) with
[Spring Framework 31](http://www.springsource.org/). This application
wasn't intended to provide fully-fledged TODO list. It's goal was to
present some new features introduced in Spring 3.1 and integration
with Backbone.js.

Features that this sample covers:

* Java-based configuration (Servlet 3.0 based web-application and
persistence layer backed by JPA and Spring Data JPA)
* Request body validation and exception handling
* Improvements in RESTful web services (produces and consumes).
